<p align="center">On Pony Town, I am VERY bad at social interaction with people I don't know!!! If you are to interact with me, PLEASE be aware of that. For example, if you talk to me or whisper me I am likely to not respond. Also, if you interact with me in character, it's likely I won't respond in character-- but if I'm feeling social and in the mood to act in character for the funsies then I might. Please also whisper me if you want to interact with me.</p>
